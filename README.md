# Quiz Night

## Description

This is Challenge #4, this code includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This weekâ€™s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## Functionality


When the user clicks the Start-Quiz-Night-Challenge button, the user is presented with a series of typical Quiz Night questions.

The quiz is timed and the high score is stored.

After answering a question, the user is shown whether or not the answer is correct.  If the answer is incorrect 10 seconds is subtracted from the score.  Another question is then presented.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over.  The user can then save their initials and their score is saved.
